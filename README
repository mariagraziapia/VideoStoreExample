VideoStore Refactoring Example
------------------------------

The following is an excerpt from: M. Fowler, Refactoring, Addison-Wesley 
Professional, 1999.

I don't like some of the variable names in amountFor, and this is a
good place to change them.

Once I've done the renaming, I compile and test to ensure I haven't
broken anything.

Is renaming worth the effort? Absolutely. Good code should communicate
what it is doing clearly, and variable names are a key to clear
code. Never be afraid to change the names of things to improve
clarity. With good find and replace tools, it is usually not
difficult. Strong typing and testing will highlight anything you
miss. Remember

Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good
programmers write code that humans can understand.

Code that communicates its purpose is very important. I often refactor
just when I'm reading some code. That way as I gain understanding
about the program, I embed that understanding into the code for later
so I don't forget what I learned.
