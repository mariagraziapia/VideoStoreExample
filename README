VideoStore Refactoring Example
------------------------------

The following is an excerpt from: M. Fowler, Refactoring, Addison-Wesley 
Professional, 1999.

I am now at the point where I can take off my refactoring hat and put
on my adding function hat. I can write htmlStatement as follows and
add appropriate tests.

By extracting the calculations I can create the htmlStatement method
and reuse all of the calculation code that was in the original
statement method. I didn't copy and paste, so if the calculation rules
change I have only one place in the code to go. Any other kind of
statement will be really quick and easy to prepare. The refactoring
did not take long. I spent most of the time figuring out what the code
did, and I would have had to do that anyway.

Some code is copied from the ASCII version, mainly due to setting up
the loop. Further refactoring could clean that up. Extracting methods
for header, footer and detail line are one route I could take. You can
see how to do this in the example for Form Template Method (345). But
now the users are clamoring again. They are getting ready to change
the classification of the movies in the store. It's still not clear
what changes they want to make, but it sounds like new classifications
will be introduced, and the existing ones could well be changed. The
charges and frequent renter point allocations for these
classifications are to be decided. At the moment, making these kind of
changes is awkward. I have to get into the charge and frequent renter
point methods and alter the conditional code to make changes to film
classifications. Back on with the refactoring hat.
