Removing Temps

As I suggested before, temporary variables can be a problem. They are
useful only within their own routine, and thus they encourage long,
complex routines. In this case we have two temporary variables, both
of which are being used to get a total from the rentals attached to
the customer. Both the ASCII and HTML versions require these totals. I
like to use Replace Temp with Query (120) to replace totalAmount and
frequentRenterPoints with query methods. Queries are accessible to any
method in the class and thus encourage a cleaner design without long,
complex methods.

I began by replacing totalAmount with a charge method on customer.

This isn't the simplest case of Replace Temp with Query (120),
totalAmount was assigned to within the loop, so I have to copy the
loop into the query method.
