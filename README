VideoStore Refactoring Example
------------------------------

The following is an excerpt from: M. Fowler, Refactoring, Addison-Wesley 
Professional, 1999.

The next thing that strikes me is that thisAmount is now redundant. It
is set to the result of each.getCharge and not changed afterward. Thus
I can eliminate thisAmount by using Replace Temp with Query (120).

Once I've made that change I compile and test to make sure I haven't
broken anything.

I like to get rid of temporary variables such as this as much as
possible. Temps are often a problem in that they cause a lot of
parameters to be passed around when they don't have to be. You can
easily lose track of what they are there for. They are particularly
insidious in long methods. Of course there is a performance price to
pay; here the charge is now calculated twice. But it is easy to
optimize that in the rental class, and you can optimize much more
effectively when the code is properly factored. I'll talk more about
that issue later in Refactoring and Performance on page 69.
